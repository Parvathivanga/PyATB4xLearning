## Task #3
# 1. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# = is an assignment operator used to carryout out the operation using operands.
# It is used for assigning the values to variables.
# where as == is comparison operator used to compare 2 variables

# 2. What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# ** is a operator used for performing power function.
# It raises the number on the left to the power of the number on the right.
# For example:(2**3)=8

# 3. What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
#The ^ operator in Python performs a bitwise XOR operation on the operands. It compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are different, the resulting bit is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.
# The ^ operator is commonly used in contexts like:
# Cryptography: For encrypting and decrypting data using XOR operations
# Bit manipulation: For performing operations on individual bits of a number
# Checking for unique elements in a list or set
# XOR table:
#  X	Y	X^Y
#  0	0	0
#  0	1	1
#  1	0	1
#  1	1	0
